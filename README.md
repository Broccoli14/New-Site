## Favorite Hobbies and Pastimes

I have started piano at a young age and although sometimes it can frustrating to play the harder pieces, overall it is a fun pastime that I enjoy.

Reading books 📚 is just a way for my mind to wander and to past times especially when I'm really bored. My favorite genres are fantasy fiction and sci-fi.

I am an atheltic person and I love playing any type of sport. I love team spirit and the bond that we share as we play together.


I started getting into collecting keychains after noticing that I have a sort of attraction to getting sourvenir keychains wherever I visited. I especially love my Taiepei 101 keychain, a space shuttle keychain, and my national park keychains, Yosemite National Park and Zion National Park to name a few I have been to.

## Favorite Foods and Drinks

My favorite foods are pizza 🍕 from Dominoes and spaghetti 🍝 from Macaroni Grill. If I was to rank them, I would say pizza over spaghetti. I also love ice cream 🍨 and my favorite flavors are strawberry and choclate.

My favorite beverage would be fruit juice 🍹. I don't care what type of fruit, but I really enjoy guave juice because of the sweet flavor.
