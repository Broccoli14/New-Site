## Team Rocket GO

Team Rocket GO grunts show up periodically at pokestops or in hot-air balloon. Sometimes Team Rocket leaders would show up, but you can see where the leaders are using the rocket radar which can be assembled once you have collected six fragments which are dropped after winning a battle against a Team Rocket GO grunt. After you win, you can also have a chance to catch a pokemon that the leader or grunt left behind, but you have to use special pokeballs that are calculated by your achievements and the number of pokemon left still alive after the battle.

## Buddies

It is recommended to add a buddy because they can improve their rating and it gives you rewards every time you upgrade your buddy status.
